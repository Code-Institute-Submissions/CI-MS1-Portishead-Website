# [Portishead (Band) Website](https://kieran-murray-code.github.io/CI-MS1-Portishead-Website/)

This is an assignemnt project for [https://codeinstitute.net/](https://codeinstitute.net/). The project aims to develop a modern mobile first website for long time fans as well new fans of the UK band Portishead. It helps them to find out information on the bands music and tour dates as well as the band's history and information on band members. See Portishead's offical website here -[Portishead's Official Webiste](https://www.portishead.co.uk/home/).

## UX:

### Design choices

The color scheme was chosen based on the band most recent album artwork -[Third Artwork](https://github.com/Kieran-Murray-Code/CI-MS1-Portishead-Website/blob/master/assets/media/images/Music/third.jpg).

I used [https://imagecolorpicker.com/en/](https://imagecolorpicker.com/en/) to generate a colour palette from the artwork image.

I looked at many popular band websites and noticed a lot of common design patterns such as the grid of music releases and photo grid.

The main site that I took design choices from were .

- [https://www.imaginedragonsmusic.com/](https://www.imaginedragonsmusic.com/)

- [https://cypresshill.com/](https://cypresshill.com/)

- [https://www.thekillersmusic.com/](https://www.thekillersmusic.com/)
